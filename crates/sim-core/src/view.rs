//! What one side is allowed to see.
//!
//! A [`SideView`] is the only thing a player, the staff planner or an agent
//! is ever handed. It exposes the side's own units exactly and the enemy only
//! as contacts. It has no method that returns enemy truth, so code holding a
//! `SideView` cannot read it.
//!
//! The umpire's view is [`crate::World::umpire`]. It is for tests, the
//! command-line runner and hashing, and must never be passed to anything that
//! plays the game.
