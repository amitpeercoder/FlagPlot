# Schemas of the agent interface

One JSON Schema file for each kind of answer the agent interface gives
(decision 0048). They are written by hand and checked, by a validator in the
tests of `crates/sim-agent`, against every answer the scenario tests produce.

Every answer is a JSON object with a top-level `"format": "flagplot-agent"`,
`"version": 1` and a `"kind"` that names it.

| Kind | File | Given by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `briefing` | `briefing.schema.json` | `briefing` |
| `list_forces` | `list_forces.schema.json` | `list_forces` |
| `list_bases` | `list_bases.schema.json` | `list_bases` |
| `list_contacts` | `list_contacts.schema.json` | `list_contacts` |
| `entity` | `entity.schema.json` | `get_entity` |
| `explain` | `explain.schema.json` | `explain` |
| `measure` | `measure.schema.json` | `measure`: one of four answers, told apart by `question` (`air_distance`, `sea_route`, `passage`, `air_reach`) |
| `not_known` | `not_known.schema.json` | `get_entity`, `explain` and `measure`, for anything the side does not know of |

`defs.schema.json` holds what the files share: the decimal string, the unit
handle, the place and the one-line summaries of a task force, an air group, a
base and a contact. Files refer to it as `defs.schema.json#/$defs/name`.
`entity.schema.json`, `explain.schema.json` and `measure.schema.json` accept
either their own answer or `not_known`.

## How numbers are written

A count of things is a JSON integer. A quantity of the game (tons, fatigue,
miles that can be a decimal, shots) is a decimal string such as `"12"` or
`"0.25"`, exactly as the game holds it. There are no JSON floats anywhere.

## The version rule

`version` is 1. A field removed from an answer, or a field whose meaning
changes, makes the version 2. A field added does not change it, so a reader
must ignore fields it does not know. (The schemas here set
`additionalProperties: false` because they describe version 1 exactly; a
reader of a newer minor change should not.)

## What is not in an answer

An answer holds nothing of the enemy that the side may not know (decisions
0012 and 0047): an enemy unit appears only as a contact or, by the log's
number, in an event the side may see. Asked about anything it does not know of,
`get_entity` and `explain` give the same `not_known` document, which carries
nothing of the question.

## measure

`measure` takes one question as a JSON object whose `question` names it
(decision 0049):

| `question` | Other fields | Answers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `air_distance` | `from`, `to`: places | the straight-line air distance, in whole miles (decision 0040) |
| `sea_route` | `from`, `to`: places | whether ships can get there, the hexes entered in order and the miles |
| `passage` | `task_force`: `"task_force:N"`; `to`: a place; `speed` (optional): `"cruise"`, `"full"` or knots above zero, `17` or `"17.5"` | a forecast of the force's passage: the route, the speed, the hours, the day, pulse and clock time of arrival, and each ship's fuel |
| `air_reach` | `air_group`: `"air_group:N"`; `to`: a list of places | the type's radius, and for each place the air distance and whether it is within the radius |

A place is `{"q": 2, "r": -4}`, or the handle of one of the side's own ships,
task forces, air groups or bases, or of a contact it holds (which stands for
the hex the side believes). Anything else gives `not_known`: an enemy unit, a
number that does not exist, a handle that is not one, a hex off the map, a
unit of the wrong kind for the question (a ship as the task force of a
passage), and a sunk ship or a group with no place. It is the same document in
every case and carries nothing of the question.

A passage is a forecast, and its `assumptions` say so in fixed words: the force
leaves at the start of the coming day, keeps the speed it makes now, meets
nobody, loses no ship and has the fuel aboard now. `order` is `refused`, with a
`refusal`, when the engine would refuse the route order (`no_route`,
`already_there`, `no_ship_afloat`) and `outcome` is then `does_not_sail`.
`route` lists every hex of the route; `entered_steps` of them are entered
before the force arrives or stops (they differ only when a ship runs dry),
and are the hexes the steaming events list. A hex the force is already in
(past the middle of a leg) is not entered again. A force with no ship that can
make way has `outcome` `cannot_move` and an empty `route`. In `air_reach`,
`within` is true when the distance is not more than the radius, the test the
strike decision makes; `radius_is` says what the radius is (`strike`, a
fighter's `escort`, or `none`, for a type that cannot strike, which reaches
nothing).

Numbers follow the rule above: whole miles and counts are integers; tons,
hours, speeds and the miles of a passage are decimal strings.
